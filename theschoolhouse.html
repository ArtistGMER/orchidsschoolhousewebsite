    <center><h1>The Schoolhouse</h1></center>
    <center><p>Our building has almost an infinate amount of space, it's why we're able to host so many children in here. The very enterance of our building can be easily spotted with the big welcome sign on the top of the building, right next to our playground. Each section of the building has its own color with the front being this ovely shade of pink. As for the photo itself, we apologize for the gate in the front. W had some complications getting a proper picture from the front.</p></center>

    	<center><h2>Our History</h2></center>
    	<center><p> Nearing the begginings of 1990, our principal, [REDACTED] had the idea of having a schoolhouse for all ages. No longer will you have the troubles of going from school to school. Why do that when you can simply have your child go here from grade K-12, up until they graduate and head into college. With this base idea, he created a mascot, Orchid, and a few other robotical helpers to get himself started. And so the project was launched, reaching its sucess within a few years. On 1993, the school offically opened, and has now been open for years on end. We've had a long history of different teachers, some that sadly ove on with their lives. But do not worrry, as we are alawys hiring here at Orchid's Schoolhouse.</p></center>>
    	<center><p> Our building has a total of 6 floors within our buuilding, each hostering a different amoiunt of room and useful areas. The first floor is the main hall, hosting the cafeteria, main office and the first level of the playroom. Floors 2-5 have the classrooms, other levels of the playroom, various bathrooms and so much more! The 6th level however, will be off limits. It is a Staff only area, and will only be accessable to those who work atthis facility. No kids will be able to get up there, but we record this floor down just so we can be as open and honest with you as we possibly can.</p></center>
